  dialogue:
  - Oh, Hello! Where did you come from?
  - Oh, well no worries it doesn't really matter.
  - I've been here for many long years and you might as well be too.
  - This is the Forgotten Isle. Stay long enough and you'll forget all your worries.
  - If you want, you can stay here and talk with the looney castaway that I am. Or
    explore the Island for yourself.
  - And if you find any coconuts, come give them to me.
  - I found this weird gem in the ground and I might be willing to trade.
  - 3 Coconuts will do.
