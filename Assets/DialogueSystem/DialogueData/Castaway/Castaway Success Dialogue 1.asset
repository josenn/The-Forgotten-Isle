  - Aye lad, that'll hit the spot! Thanks for gathering the coconuts for me. As promised,
    here's that shiny bauble for ya.
  - "If you head east from here there is another island. There's a Captain who's
    docked his ship there. \n"
  - He's a bit of a rude, arrogant drunk if you ask me. But he COULD take you across
    the water is that's where yer headed.
  - 'I''ve been working on building a bridge to get across, might be more coconuts
    over there..........

'
  - "But unfortunately it's not done yet, and it'll probably take me years to complete!
    \n"
  - 'So I''ll guess you''ll just have to learn to love coconuts and boredom, like
    I have.
